*** ROUSE DNA CHAIN WITH BROWNIAN PROTEIN ***

The file model1.f90 will simulate the movement of a DNA chain consisting of 101 beads with identical harmonic springs, generated under the Freely Jointed Chain model with initial bond length equal to their Kuhn length,

The script runs 1000 simulations at each of 10 initial separations between the protein (e.g. RNA polymerase) and the middle bead on the DNA chain. It outputs the proportion of simulations in which binding was successful.
